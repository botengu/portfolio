     The purpose of this work was to reinforce my knowledge of parametrized surfaces. Since I have learned a couple of theoretical concepts, it was an opportunity for me to verify if I understood things correctly. The first concept I wanted to test was the Mobius strip. Take a rectangle and glue two of its opposite sides; what you obtain is a hollow cylinder. Now, if you take the same rectangle but apply a twist to one side before you glue it to its opposite side, you get a Mobius strip, a one-sided surface.

    <p class = "justify">
In the event where two Mobius strips are glued together on their side, the resulting shape is called a Klein bottle. Both the parametric equations for the Klein bottle and the Mobius strip were found on Wikipedia. The Klein bottle and the morphing of the Mobius strip into the Klein bottle can be shown below. Keep in mind that this morphing technic does not show how two Mobius strips are glued to give the Klein bottle but just a common parametric morphing.

    For my research, I happen to use Bezier curves and surfaces a lot. Bezier curves are drawn using control points. The resulting curve starts at the first control and ends at the last control point but does not pass by the intermediary control points.

    More on Bezier surface can be found in the post<a class = "ex1 ex3" href="/portfolio/cad/nDBezier/" target="_blank"> "BÃ©zier objects in higher dimensions" </a>. When the points represent experimental data, Bezier curves and surfaces are a great way of averaging the results.
