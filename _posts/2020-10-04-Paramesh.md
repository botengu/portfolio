    An equation can usually take two forms, it can either be general or be parametric. To showcase the difference between the two forms, here is how the general form and the parametric form would look like for the equation of a sphere. <br>
    General form: 
    $$ {x^2+y^2+z^2} = r^2 $$
    Parametric form: 
    $$ x= r \cdot cos(\phi)\cdot sin(\theta) $$
    $$ y= r \cdot cos(\phi)\cdot sin(\theta) $$
    $$ z= r \cdot sin(\phi) $$
    where r is the radius of the sphere and where \(\theta \) and \(\phi \) are the angular parameters that are used to span the whole sphere from its centr. ( \( 0 \leq \theta \leq \pi\) and \( 0 \leq \phi \leq 2\pi\) ). 
    The parametric form uses additional parameters to express the cartesian coordinates. More shapes can be represented in parametric form. This is also because we can choose the amount of parameters on which the cartesian coordinates will depend. For example, we can create a curve in 3D by making all three coordinates dependent on only one parameter, which cannot be done using general form.  We can also create a surface in 3D by making the cartesian coordinates dependent on two parameters. <br>

    The parametric form also has disadvantages. The technic I use to do implicit modeling in python is done quickly by creating 3 arrays of the same dimensions, representing the x, y and z coordinates. Those arrays can be added, multiplied, subtracted etc.. like normal variables to obtain a final array \( f(x,y,z) \). The final result is an array of points. Each point has a value.
    Creating a solid is the equivalent of creating a border between the points that are below a certain value and the ones that are above that value. That border is commonly referred to as the isocontour.

    Transforming a paramterized surface into a mesh allows the surface to be manufacturable.
    The main issue that lies in the fact that, when it comes to parametrized surfaces, there is not always a relation between the x,y and z values. Therefore we have to use other methods.<br>
    There are two ways to go about it: 
    <ul>
        <li>The first method consists in taking each point of the grid and measuring its distance to all of the points of the parametric surface. Then, each point of the grid can be given a value based on its distance to the closest point on the surface. To control the thickness, we can fix a threshold value at which the contours will be drawn</li>
        <li>The second way consists in generating the values of the gridpoints through the addition of fields. The spherical fields are examples of fields that can be used to this end. Examples of spherical fields can be seen in the project <a class = "ex1 ex3" href="/portfolio/cad/metaballs/" target="_blank"> "Primitive shapes in implicit modeling" </a>. For the method to work, spherical fields, centered at each point of the parametrized surface, should be iteratively added to the value of each gridpoint. The main issue with this method is that each field affects all gridpoints' value. It is thus necessary to minimize the impact of a field. The spherical field formula (developed in a previous project) needs to be restricted using an additional variable \(\tau\):
        $$f(x,y,z) = {r^2  \over {((x-a)^2+(y-b)^2+(z-c)^2)^{\tau}}  }$$
        </li>
      </ul>

     For the same amount of points on the parametrized surface, method 1 was quicker, however, method 2 gave smoother results. Also, method 2 does not require as much points on the parametrized surface as method 1 and could thus potentially run faster.
