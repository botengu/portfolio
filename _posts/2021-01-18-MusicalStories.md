Now, this is probably the first project that I have started which does not require any form of math. I am starting this project as a display of love for my passion: Music. I am also doing this to pay tribute to some of my favorite musicians.<br>
The project consists of youtube videos; I will go over some musical styles/patterns as well as some musical anecdotes, obtained from readings or interviews, and I will use them to provide insights into our social life and society in general.
