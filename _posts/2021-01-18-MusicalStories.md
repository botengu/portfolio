Now, this is probably the first project that I have started which does not require any form of math. I am starting this project as a display of love for my passion: Music. I am also doing this to pay tribute to some of my favorite musicians.<br>
The project consists of youtube videos; I go over some musical styles/patterns as well as some musical anecdotes, obtained from readings or interviews, and I then use them to provide insights into our social life and society in general.
<br>
<br>
In my videos I do not like to blatantly state facts about a certain artists or a musical styles. I make analysis and I narrate a story around my analysis. The themes of the videos are introduced by an artist or a band, but ultimately the artist/band is just a stepping stone to talk about the theme. The themes of the videos I make usually revolved around three topics. 
<br>
The first topic is the creative artistic process. The videos in that virtual category are usually a bit more techinical as they involve elements that are relevant to the creation of musical, dance or even fashion concepts. Those elements are usually highlighted to show how some musical trends are similar or different.

The second topic pertains to leadership and band management. I call it the "politics" topic. More than once, I have used the politics of a band as a microcosm of larger structures such as companies, villages or even empires.

Last but not least, there is the "cultural phenomenon" topic. This one is a bit more deep. It is where I put on my ethnomusicologist hat and discuss how cultural concepts resurface implicitly or explicitly in songs and musical performances. Concepts such as mariage, witchcraft and religion are discussed.

Finally, other videos combine more than one of those topics.
