    <p class = "justify">
    Structural topology optimization is a process in which topologies, sizes and layouts of structures are altered through the maximization, minimization of an objective function while applying specific constraints. The results of such a process are sometimes hard to manufacture, therefore, the results can be used to vary the density of objects. The advancements in additive manufacturing have allowed for such intricate shapes to be printed.
