<br>
So... I finally used AI to render my sketches!
<br>
<br>
During the lockdown, I designed 3D sketches of buildings, but I had a hard time turning them into decent renderings.
<br>
<br>
That problem was solved using Stable Diffusion and Control Nets. I'm not completely satisfied with the final renderings, but for now, they'll do.
<br>
<br>
The afro-futuristic architectural designs shown in the video below have been inspired by cultural elements of the Bamilike people, an ethnic group located in grassfields of the west part of Cameroon (A nation in Central Africa). 
<br>
<br>
The buildings are part of a space that I've named: Mileka (the first name that came to mind, although I know some of you will understand why...)

To learn more about the buildings and the historical figures they've been named after, I invite you to take a look at my architectural portfolio below:

Disclaimer:
<br>

I have not been mandated by anyone. The renderings shown here are purely for aesthetical display and are not a part of a bigger plan to be constructed in real life or whatsoever. They are just the products of a "wandering mind".

<br>
This project was entirely made by me. I used Rhino3D to make the sketches. Only the architectural renderings were done using AI (stable diffusion with Control Nets).
