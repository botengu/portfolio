        Talk about the need to interpret financial data. 

        Take an example. 

        Talk about the type of info that is relevant using charts for a given period  (standard deviation and progression)

        Talk about how regression is a good tool for that 
        (how to incorporate the most amount of useful info inside chart) 

        The volume is also indicated with color as it was better 

        Talk what is still lacking linear regression is not enough 

        Normalization, is a good comparison tool 

        Take an example where I take two stocks, show their evolution and compare the two stocks
